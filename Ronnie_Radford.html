        <h2 id="overview" style="color:var(--accent)">Player Overview</h2>
        <p class="lead">Ronald "Ronnie" Radford's football career would be largely forgotten if not for one extraordinary moment. On a muddy Edgar Street pitch in February 1972, his thunderous volley against top-flight Newcastle United became the goal that defined FA Cup giant-killing romance. The BBC's Match of the Day replayed it endlessly, making it one of the most iconic moments in English football history. Radford was a solid, hardworking midfielder in non-league football - he'd played for Leeds United's youth team but spent his career in the Southern League. That goal in the 3rd Round replay not only forced extra time (Hereford won 2-1) but became a cultural phenomenon, symbolizing everything magical about the FA Cup. He scored more than 100 career goals across lower leagues, but that single strike ensured immortality.</p>

        <h2 id="global-impact" style="color:var(--accent)">Global Impact Analysis</h2>
        <p class="lead"><strong>Cultural Icon Status:</strong> Radford's impact transcends his actual playing ability. His goal became a symbol of everything romantic about English football - the non-league team, the muddy pitch, the giant-killing upset, the thunderous strike. It's shown every FA Cup season and has been viewed millions of times.</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Memorialization:</strong> When he died in March 2022, tributes poured in from across football. John Motson said it made his career. Hereford United fans erected memorials. A statue commemorating the moment stands at Hereford's stadium. The goal is used in montages to represent FA Cup romance.</p>
        <p class="small"><strong>Historical Significance:</strong> The goal represents a simpler, more romantic era of football, before money dominated the sport. The footage quality - grainy, muddy, black and white - adds to its mythical status. It represents an era when football was working class entertainment and giant-killings felt truly possible.</p>
